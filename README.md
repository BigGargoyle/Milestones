# Milestones


Milestones is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps you keep track of your project's progress by allowing you to set milestones and track your progress towards them.

## Features

Milestone is a feature that allows you to set a goal for your project and track your progress towards it. You can set a milestone by clicking on the menu icon in the Milestone TreeView bar and then clicking on the "Add Milestone" button. You can then set a name for the milestone and a due date.

When you have set a milestone, you can change the due date by clicking on the calendar icon next to the milestone name. You can also mark the milestone as completed by clicking on the checkmark icon next to the milestone name. You can also delete the milestone by clicking on the remove icon next to the milestone name.

You can modify the milestones state also by writing comments in the code. You can write a comment in the code that contains the keyword "MILESTONE" followed by the name of the milestone.
That means that there is a place where you are working on the milestone. If you click on the milestone in the Milestone TreeView bar, your cursor will be moved to the place where you wrote the comment. You can also mark the milestone as completed by writing a comment that contains the keyword "MILESTONE" followed by the name of the milestone and the word "DONE".

```javascript
// MILESTONE My_milestone
// MILESTONE My_another_milestone_that_is_done DONE
```
